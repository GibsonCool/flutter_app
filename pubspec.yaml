# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
# following page: https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
# 开发环境依赖的工具包（而不是flutter应用本身依赖的包）
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: XiaoWei
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/ZCOOLXiaoWei-Regular.ttf
          weight: 900  # TODO：这里官网指的是对应FontWeight的值，但是测试设置了看不出效果，待研究
    - family: KuaiLe
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/ZCOOLKuaiLe-Regular.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
